# audio_visualizer_with_rhythmic_goku
My project is an audio visualizer with 5 different forms made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It uses the Audio Web API to analyze sound and generate dynamic graphics that adapt to the beats of the music. In addition, it has a Goku animation that charges chi according to the intensity of the sound.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills in web development and graphic design, as well as create an interactive and fun experience for users.

The project is available on GitHub, where you can view the source code, usage instructions, and an online demo. I hope you like my work and feel free to give me feedback or suggestions for improvement.
